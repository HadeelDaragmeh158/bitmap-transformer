# bitmap-transformer

- The CLI should be architected using best modularization practices.
- The CLI should contain a Bitmap class, and reading in a file should create a new Bitmap instance.
- The CLI should require at least three arguments: input-file-path output-file-path transfrom-name.
- The CLI should support a minimum of three transforms, each of which is an instance method in the Bitmap class.
- The CLI should log useful Error messages if used incorrectly.
- The CLI should log a success message on completion.
